# VN-RW
A visual novel reader and writer, "VN-RW" for short.

VN-RW Aims to bring a way to write visual novels for the less technical, as well as open and read
VN-RW compatable projects. By the end of VN-RW's devopment cycle and eventual birth, we plan to have a
fully functional standard visual novel reader, and writer that will be able to maintain, create, and 
open projects built by artists. This program will work in a variety of multiple platforms including Windows,
MacOS, and Linux. 

# Dependancies
VN-RW currently uses the following libraries outside of the standard library:
    chnutil
    
# Documentation
To see the javadocs for this project look [here](http://bradleycai.github.io/VN-RW/doc/index.html)

There will be a way to create vn's in an easier and more user friendly way but
for now, to create VN-RW readable VNC(Visual Novel Code) use the documentation [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12gLGcnaq5fAESRVK-VeoAwwO_Xqbdti6EL8kpePUJw8/edit?usp=sharing)
